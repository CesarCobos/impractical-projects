### Regaeton lyrics generator  
*Dec/2021*
  
This code reads some lists with verbs and commons words used, by a structure and a random selection generates the lyrics, then creates and show a TXT file with it. If the "lyrics" file exists then it replace the content, if not a new file is created.
  
Created with Python 3.10, should work with an older version
